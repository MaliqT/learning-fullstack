# Full Stack Development
This repo will consist of my learning about full stack development. This will be in an agile setting using version control with GitHub. Changes, issues, fixes will all be posted here when working on this project.
This project will follow the steps along roadmap.sh fullstack component. 

### 1. Learning HTML
The first step is learning HTMl/CSS. This is to display the contents of a webpage to the user. Only context and style of the webpage will be handled throughout HTMl and CSS. Thus far, the
start of an html file has the document type (!DOCTYPE html), the language of the page (html lang="en") and the character encoding (meta charset="UTF-8"). From here, the web page
will have a head that contains meta information about the document as well as holding scripts. This is not seen on the web page. Afterwards, a body is created that contains all visible content and html elements such as div, 
section, article, header, footer, etc. All enclosed between <>.
